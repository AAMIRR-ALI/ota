Notes : 
- Clean Flash is mandatory since whole source was rebased so to avoid any unwanted  
  bugs, clean flash. 
- Rom is encrypted by default.
- If you want to be decrypted, flash dfe_v4 after flashing the ROM.
  Gapps And Firmware are shipped default with Rom.
- CTS passes by default.
- Stay away from magisk latest one as it is giving sometimes bootloop and u may neet to rename the file from recovery to uninstall.zip and flash then reboot.....
  so better stay away from it
  tried to add micam build is also posted but potrait is broken and once u click on potrait mode u need to clear its data and reopen again to fix it
